# Background

Hi.  I'm Anthony.

As I write this, the world is in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
After almost six months at home, we're all a little tired of quarantine.

That's probably why, over the past few weeks, I've had a few friends
and family start looking for things to do.  I've been honored to have
some of them ask me where to start learning data science, software development,
or statistics.

After you hear these questions a few times, you start thinking, "Hey, it may 
easier to just write this up myself instead of doing all of this searching."
At least, I did.

I was wrong.
